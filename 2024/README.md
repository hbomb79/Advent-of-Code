# Aoc2024

Advent of Code solutions for 2024, written in Elixir.

To run, ensure you have Elixir installed; this should see you have Elixir _and_ its build system 'Mix' installed.

>[!NOTE]
> Puzzles inputs are not stored in this repository (as it is not allowed). To run these solutions against your own
> inputs, place them in `lib/puzzles/input` using the `dayXX[-example].txt` format

**Usage:**
```
mix solve --day 01
```

**Options:**
* `--part | -p`: Optionally specify the part to solve (as an integer, 1 or 2). If not specified, solves both parts
* `--test | -t`: Optionally solve the puzzle using the example input rather than the full input
